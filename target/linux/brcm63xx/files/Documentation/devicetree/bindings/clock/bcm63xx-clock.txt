* Broadcom BCM63XX Clock bindings

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: one of
  a) "brcm,bcm63xx-clock"
  Standard BCM63XX clock.
  b) "brcm,bcm63xx-sar-clock"
  SAR/ATM clock, which requires a reset of the SAR/ATM block.
  c) "brcm,bcm63xx-enetsw-clock"
  Generic ethernet switch clock, which requires a reset of the block.
  d) "brcm,bcm6368-enetsw-clock"
  BCM6368 ethernet switch clock, which requires additional clocks to be
  enabled during reset.

Optional properties:
- brcm,gate-bit: gate bit in the clock control register.

- clock-frequency: frequency of this clock.

Example:

	hsspi: clock@9 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm63xx-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "hsspi";
		brcm,gate-bit = <9>;
		clock-frequency = <133333333>;
	};
